  </header>
  <p>Hi, I'm Ty Aponte, i moved to CA from Fl a few years ago. I've been Lab Tech certified, CCMA certified, LPXT certified, and now I wrestle code. I did the Army thing for a little while, then went into medicine. After medicine scorched my soul for a few years I decided to pursue coding. I hope to one day be the best. At everything. Some say it's a complex, but some people actually support my dreams MOM.</p>
